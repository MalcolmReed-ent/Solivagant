Known Issues in solivagant
==========================

Metadata
--------
Description: 
   Metadata display is currently a placeholder.

Impact:
   Low. This is primarily a preference for viewing book information.


Compilation Issues with Certain CFLAGS
--------------------------------------
Description: 
   The program compiles with current GCC flags, but using "-std=c99" 
   breaks compilation. Adding "#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200809L" 
   doesn't resolve the issue and causes further errors.
   
   Working CFLAGS:
   CFLAGS = -Wall -g -O3 $(shell pkg-config --cflags libzip libxml-2.0 json-c)
   
   Non-working CFLAGS (from dwm):
   CFLAGS = -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Wno-deprecated-declarations -Os \
   $(shell pkg-config --cflags libzip libxml-2.0 json-c)

Impact:
   Low if using default settings. May affect users on Gentoo or those 
   who prefer to tweak compiler settings.


Color Scheme Persistence
------------------------
Description:
   When toggling the color scheme and then changing chapters, the terminal 
   reverts to its default colors. This may be specific to certain terminal 
   emulators (e.g., Suckless terminal).

Impact:
   Aesthetic only. Does not affect functionality.


Table and Image Handling
------------------------
Description:
   Tables and images in EPUB files are not currently supported or 
   are poorly rendered in the text-based interface.

Impact:
   Books with significant visual elements or tabular data may lose 
   important information or context.
